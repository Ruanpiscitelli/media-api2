###
üß† Debugging & Best Practices
Always check official documentation first before implementing or troubleshooting.
If a solution doesn't work, analyze the codebase and fix another error instead of getting stuck.
Explain errors in simple, short descriptions to ensure quick resolution.
All code must be commented in Portuguese for clarity.
Always verify if similar code exists before creating a new function to avoid redundancy.

###
üîç Problem-Solving Approach
When facing a problem, write two detailed paragraphs explaining possible solutions.
Do not jump to conclusions too quickly‚Äîanalyze different angles before deciding.
Compare the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and explain which one is the best.
Only after a thorough analysis, implement the best solution.
